# sequester C as LIFE

SQL.ag is entirely driven by the NEED to sustainably optimizing quality of soil for the long-term fitness of the soil to accomplish human purposes. 

It's immediately about what the owner of the soil needs to accomplish... but it telescopically throughout the ages to  include those purposes are about very the long-term or of benefit to others. 

Soil quality depends upon productivity in LIVING soil ecosystems ... it's not primarily about the barren, lifeless realm of chemistry, moleculess, information or artifical intelligence, even though those things matter a great deal as inputs for improving LIVING soil ecosystems.

Our motto is ***sequester C as LIFE***  ... we improve quality for the sake of improving long-term productivty and while maximizing immediate value in every sense of the word.
